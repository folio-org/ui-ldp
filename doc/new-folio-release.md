# Preparing for a new FOLIO release

In general each flower release of FOLIO requires many modules to be re-released

* `ui-courses` (seems to have landed back with me since we lost Mark)
* `ui-plugin-eusage-reports`
* `ui-ldp`
* `ui-harvester-admin` (not in MG, but needs to be compatible with it)
* `mod-graphql` (not Stripes, but part of the periodic release pain)
* `Net-Z3950-FOLIO` (likewise)
